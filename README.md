# 🔐 Smart Secure Vault

Smart Secure Vault is a Python-based file security tool that uses AES (Fernet) encryption to securely encrypt and decrypt files. Designed to be simple, powerful, and extensible.

---

## ✅ Features

- AES encryption & decryption using Fernet
- Command-line interface
- Password-protected encryption
- Lightweight and easy to use

### 🧪 Upcoming Features

- Facial recognition for secure access
- GUI using Tkinter
- Access logging and alerts
- Machine learning–based anomaly detection

---

## 🚀 Installation


### Requirements
- Python 3.8 or above

### Setup Instructions

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Sandy853/Smart-Secure-Vault.git
cd Smart-Secure-Vault

# Install required Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
## 💡 How to Use

1. Place any file you want to secure (e.g., `secret.txt`) in the project folder.

2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python encryptor.py
   ```
3. The script will:

      * Generate an encryption key and save it in key.key

      * Encrypt the file and save it as filename.ext.enc

      * Decrypt the file and save it as decrypted_filename.ext

## 📦 Tech Stack
- Python 3

- cryptography library (Fernet)

- (Optional, for future use) OpenCV, Tkinter, scikit-learn
